# **Enhancing Naive Bayes Classifier with Discretization Techniques**

Naive Bayes is a foundational algorithm in machine learning, celebrated for its simplicity, speed, and effectiveness in classification tasks. Despite its strengths, traditional implementations often struggle with continuous data and assume feature independenceâ€”limitations that can impact real-world performance.

This project explores innovative methods to enhance the Naive Bayes classifier by introducing discretization techniques and advanced probability modeling. By converting continuous variables into manageable categories and applying robust estimation techniques, we aim to improve the algorithm's adaptability and accuracy across diverse datasets.
